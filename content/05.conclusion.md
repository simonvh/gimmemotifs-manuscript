# Conclusions

To demonstrate the functionality of GimmeMotifs we presented three examples.
To evaluate different public motif databases, we quantified their performance on
distinguishing ChIP-seq peaks from background sequences. The databases that
perform best on this benchmark are collections of individual databases.

We benchmarked 14 different *de novo* motif finders using a large compendium of
ChIP-seq data. While performance can vary between different data sets, there are
several *de novo* motif finders that consistently perform well, with
BioProspector, BioProspector and Homer as top performers. Interestingly, only
Homer was specifically developed for ChIP-seq data. An ensemble approach such as
GimmeMotifs still improves on the use of individual tools. This example also
illustrates that newly developed *de novo* motif finders should be evaluated on
many different data sets, as this is necessary to accurately judge the
performance.

Outlook.
